The `waitForElementInNewPage` function in the loginPage.ts file is used to wait for the element to appear, but since it doesn't exist or is hidden, the test fails.\n\nSuggestion:\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check if the \"Plan\" element exists on the page after upgrading to the \"Standard\" plan. If it doesn't, then you may need to adjust your upgrade flow or check for any potential issues with your UI.\n2. If the element does exist, but is not visible, you can try using a different locator strategy (e.g., CSS selector instead of XPath) to locate the element.\n3.

        "output": "A fascinating case of a test suite that's stuck in an infinite loop!\n\nIt appears that the test is retrying the click action for element \"is not enabled\" with increasing attempt numbers (from #1 to #62). This suggests that the condition being checked (\"element is not enabled\") is not changing, causing the test to keep trying indefinitely.\n\nTo help debug this issue, I'd like to ask a few questions:\n\n1. What is the expected behavior of this test? Should it succeed or fail?\n2. Can you provide more context about the element that's being clicked and its expected state (enabled/disabled)?\n3. Are there any other logs or errors that might indicate what's causing the issue?\n\nIn the meantime, I'd suggest temporarily modifying the test to introduce a delay between retries, like this:\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 1; i <= 62; i++) {\n  // retry click action with increasing attempt numbers\n  await retryClickAction(i);\n  if (/* condition satisfied */) {\n    break;\n  }\n}\n```\nThis might help us identify whether the issue is related to timing or something else.\n\n"

It could be due to a variety of reasons such as:\n\n1. Element is not properly located on the page.\n2. Element is not enabled due to some condition or validation.\n3. There is a timing issue where the element becomes available after the retry attempts.\n\nTo resolve this, we can try the following:\n\n* Verify the element's location and availability on the page.\n* Check if there are any enabling conditions or validations that need to be met before the element becomes clickable.\n* If it's a timing issue, consider adding more sleep time between retries or using a more robust retry mechanism.\n\nBy analyzing the log and identifying the root cause of the issue, we can develop a plan to resolve this failed test case suite!\n\n"

This suggests that there might be an issue with the UI element or its enabling conditions.\n* The retry attempts are being made every 500ms, which could be causing the test to run slowly and potentially leading to timeouts or failures.\n* After the 60th attempt, the script moves on to another step (1219), but it's unclear what this step does or whether it's related to the previous issue.\n\nSome potential next steps:\n\n1. Inspect the UI element being targeted by the click action to ensure it is indeed not enabled and why.\n2. Check if there are any enabling conditions that need to be met before attempting to interact with the element.\n3. Consider implementing a more robust retry mechanism or timeout settings to avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n4. Review the test script's logic to identify any potential issues or bottlenecks.\n\nOverall, this failure suggests that there might be some UI-related issues or timing problems that need to be addressed to get the test running successfully.\n\n"
