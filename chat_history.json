This could be due to the element not being present on the page, or it's not being loaded within the specified timeout.\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Verify if the \"Upgrade to Standard\" plan element exists and is visible on the page.\n2. Check the element's location and ensure that it's not being obscured by any other elements.\n3. If the element is present, try reducing the timeout value in the `waitForElementInNewPage` method to see if it resolves the issue.\n4. Consider using a more robust waiting mechanism, such as retrying the element lookup with shorter intervals or using a fluent wait approach.\n5. Review the test script and ensure that all dependencies are met before attempting to locate the plan element.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the error and get your test running successfully."}]
