This suggests that the element may not be present on the page, or it's taking longer than expected to appear.\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Verify if the [Plan] element is indeed present on the page after upgrading to the \"Upgrade to Standard\" plan.\n2. Check the timing and adjust it accordingly to give the page enough time to load the new plan details.\n3. Implement a more robust way to handle waiting for the element, such as using a more reliable locator or increasing the timeout value.\n\nAdditional suggestions:\n\n* Review the test steps and ensure that they are correct and align with the expected behavior of the application.\n* Check if there are any other issues or errors occurring during the test execution.\n* Consider adding more logging or debugging statements to gain more insights into the issue."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Generate a solution code in TypeScript for the problem."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's an example of how you can modify the `loginPage.ts` file to handle the waiting for the `[Plan]` element:\n```typescript\nimport { Element } from 'actions';\n\nclass LoginPage {\n  // ...\n\n  async waitForElementInNewPage(locator: Locator, timeout = 30000) {\n    try {\n      await browser.waitUntil(() => this.isPlanElementVisible(locator), timeout);\n    } catch (error) {\n      throw new Error(`Failed to find the ${locator} element after waiting for time: ${timeout} milliseconds`);\n    }\n  }\n\n  private async isPlanElementVisible(locator: Locator): Promise<boolean> {\n    await browser.sleep(500); // wait for a bit before checking if the element is visible\n    return (await browser.findElements(locator)).length > 0;\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we've added a new method `isPlanElementVisible` that checks if the `[Plan]` element is visible on the page. We're using `browser.findElements` to get a list of elements matching the locator, and then checking if the length of that list is greater than 0.\n\nWe're also updating the `waitForElementInNewPage` method to use this new method to wait for the element to be visible. If the element is not found within the specified timeout, an error will be thrown with a more descriptive message.\n\nYou can then use this modified `loginPage.ts` file in your test steps to upgrade and downgrade plans. For example:\n```typescript\nasync CustomWorld.<anonymous>() {\n  // ...\n  await loginPage.waitForElementInNewPage(locator('xpath=(//p[contains(text(), \"Launch\")])[1]/ancestor::button[1]'));\n  // ...\n}\n```\nNote that you may need to adjust the timeout value and the waiting mechanism based on your specific application's behavior."}]
